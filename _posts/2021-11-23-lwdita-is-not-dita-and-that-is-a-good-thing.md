After 6 years as member (and some 4 as co-chair) of the Lightweight DITA (**LwDITA**) subcommittee, I officially said goodbye this week. I also said goodbye to the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (**DITA**) technical committee (TC) with the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).

Without a doubt, a big reason for this departure is that my current job(s) as CTO and associate dean in College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences at Virginia Tech do not give me a lot of time for volunteer work that is not related to a specific research project. However, there are other reasons for my departure, and those are connected to the obstacles and requirements that the DITA TC put in the way of the LwDITA subcommittee to make it produce a technical specification that did not address the needs of actual and potential LwDITA users and, as a result, will probably never see the light of day.

## The LwDITA promise

If you really want to read a lot about the history of LwDITA, I recommend a [very good book on the subject](https://www.routledge.com/Creating-Intelligent-Content-with-Lightweight-DITA/Evia/p/book/9780815393825). Here, I am going to focus on the original promise of LwDITA that attracted me (then a recently-tenured professor of technical communication) to the world of standards development for technical content. I had been teaching DITA and DITA-related tools and processes in my courses at Virginia Tech since 2005, and I followed on Twitter a few big DITA names, including some members of the TC and particularly the official *parents* of DITA: Don Day and Michael Priestley, who were part of the IBM team that created the syntax-turned-standard in the late 1990s.

Seven years ago, Michael published a blog post titled "[Overview of Lightweight DITA (XDITA and HDITA](http://dita-archive.xml.org/blog/overview-of-lightweight-dita-xdita-and-hdita)," which in essence acknowledged that the DITA standard was perceived as too complex by individuals who were interested in its proven capabilities for content reuse, structuring, single sourcing, and publishing. Michael said that although industries "such as publishing, pharmaceutical, and aerospace" were still ok with the requirements and constraints of DITA, others were struggling to embrace the standard with its dozens of XML tags and hundreds of pages in a detailed technical specification. 

Michael proposed to create LwDITA as a parallel standard, with the primary objectives of simplifying the DITA XML model (**XDITA**) and creating the syntax for representing that simplified DITA model in HTML5 (**HDITA**). I did not know Michael personally at the time, but I started corresponding with him as I created some demos of XDITA and HDITA with my students and a Computer Science colleague here at VT. LwDITA became a thing and in conferences and blog-Twitter circuits people were talking about it. As a result, the DITA TC decided to embrace LwDITA as a gateway to DITA and it created the official Lightweight DITA subcommittee with OASIS. Good stuff, and I joined the TC in order to be a member of the SC. I paid the organizational membership with OASIS in order to play with the DITA big names.

I remember when some TC members defended LwDITA as others claimed that a simplified version of the standard went against its directive of intense structure for content. In hindsight, I can see how that defense was faulty. Instead of defending/proposing LwDITA as a solution to a problem that some were already solving with non-standard hacks, the defense was that LwDITA was good as a stepping stone that would make people realize how incomplete it was and then they would adopt DITA. LwDITA, for non-TC members who would listen to Michael, Don, and others at conferences and online chats, was a unique standard for lightweight content environments that still offered some DITA-like capabilities. To some (most?) members of the DITA TC, LwDITA was nothing without DITA and it would eventually bring its users to DITA.
