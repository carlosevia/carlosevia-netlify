title: LwDITA is not DITA (and that is a good thing)

intro_paragraph: After seven years as member (and some 4 as co-chair) of the
  Lightweight DITA (LwDITA) subcommittee, I officially said goodbye this week. I
  also said goodbye to the DITA technical committee with OASIS. Without a doubt,
  a big reason for this departure is that my current job(s) as CTO and associate
  dean in VT CLAHS do not give me a lot of time for volunteer work that is not
  related to a specific research project. However, there are other reasons for
  my departure, and those are connected to the obstacles and requirements that
  the DITA TC put in the way of the LwDITA subcommittee in order to produce a
  technical specification that did not address the needs of actual and potential
  LwDITA users and, as a result, will probably never see the light of day.
