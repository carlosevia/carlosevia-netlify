After 6 years as member (and some 4 as co-chair) of the Lightweight DITA (**LwDITA**) subcommittee, I officially said goodbye this week. I also said goodbye to the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (**DITA**) technical committee (TC) with the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).

Without a doubt, a big reason for this departure is that my current job(s) as CTO and associate dean in College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences at Virginia Tech do not give me a lot of time for volunteer work that is not related to a specific research project. However, there are other reasons for my departure, and those are connected to the obstacles and requirements that the DITA TC put in the way of the LwDITA subcommittee to make it produce a technical specification that did not address the needs of actual and potential LwDITA users and, as a result, will probably never see the light of day.

## The LwDITA promise

If you really want to read a lot about the history of LwDITA, I recommend a [very good book on the subject](https://www.routledge.com/Creating-Intelligent-Content-with-Lightweight-DITA/Evia/p/book/9780815393825). Here, I am going to focus on the original promise of LwDITA that attracted me (then a recently-tenured professor of technical communication) to the world of standards development for technical content. I had been teaching DITA and DITA-related tools and processes in my courses at Virginia Tech since 2005, and I followed on Twitter a few big DITA names, including some members of the TC and particularly the official *parents* of DITA: Don Day and Michael Priestley, who were part of the IBM team that created the syntax-turned-standard in the late 1990s.

Seven years ago, Michael published a blog post titled "[Overview of Lightweight DITA (XDITA and HDITA](http://dita-archive.xml.org/blog/overview-of-lightweight-dita-xdita-and-hdita)," which in essence acknowledged that the DITA standard was perceived as too complex by individuals who were interested in its proven capabilities for content reuse, structuring, single sourcing, and publishing. Michael said that although industries "such as publishing, pharmaceutical, and aerospace" were still ok with the requirements and constraints of DITA, others were struggling to embrace the standard with its dozens of XML tags and hundreds of pages in a detailed technical specification. 

Michael proposed to create LwDITA as a parallel standard, with the primary objectives of simplifying the DITA XML model (**XDITA**) and creating the syntax for representing that simplified DITA model in HTML5 (**HDITA**). I did not know Michael personally at the time, but I started corresponding with him as I created some demos of XDITA and HDITA with my students and a Computer Science colleague here at VT. LwDITA became a thing and in conferences and blog-Twitter circuits people were talking about it. As a result, the DITA TC decided to embrace LwDITA as a gateway to DITA and it created the official Lightweight DITA subcommittee with OASIS. Good stuff, and I joined the TC in order to be a member of the SC. I paid the organizational membership with OASIS in order to play with the DITA big names.

I remember when some TC members defended LwDITA as others claimed that a simplified version of the standard went against its directive of intense structure for content. In hindsight, I can see how that defense was faulty. Instead of defending/proposing LwDITA as a solution to a problem that some were already solving with non-standard hacks, the defense was that LwDITA was good as a stepping stone that would make people realize how incomplete it was and then they would adopt DITA. LwDITA, for non-TC members who would listen to Michael, Don, and others at conferences and online chats, was a unique standard for lightweight content environments that still offered some DITA-like capabilities. To some (most?) members of the DITA TC, LwDITA was nothing without DITA and it would eventually bring its users to DITA. 

I noticed that problematic acceptance of LwDITA as a product of the DITA TC, but at the time I was a newbie member and didn't have the reputation to argue with the DITA big names. I was planning an "I will show them how cool LwDITA can be!" response. But I got sidetracked by a game-changing LwDITA feature that I started developing with Michael, Jen Schlotfeldt, and Jarno Elovirta: a Markdown-based LwDITA flavor (**MDITA**). MDITA allowed authors to create content in Markdown using DITA-like practices and features like maps, topics, and content and key references for reuse. I focused all of my research time on MDITA, and Jarno kindly implemented my ideas on transatlantic conversations. At the DITA North America conference in April 2015, Michael, Jen, and I presented a demo of the three LwDITA flavors: it all worked perfectly. **LwDITA was done**. 2015. Take a bow. Test it. Do some research with users. Refine the syntax. Publish an article. Go on a couple of podcasts and talk about it. Talk to vendors who want to implement LwDITA. Win an award (which Michael and I did).

But we were under the TC rules. 

## The TC wants a LwDITA spec

(*and Carlos needs a book for promotion to full professor*)

The main deliverable of the LwDITA SC with OASIS was a technical specification. After all, that's the purpose of any group working under OASIS: create and publish a standard. But, what does a LwDITA spec look like? The subcommittee, then without Don Day and with the frequent input of Alan Houser, Mark Giffin, and Stan Doherty, determined that the LwDITA spec would become the ultimate LwDITA project. The spec would be a collection of topics authored in XDITA, HDITA, and MDITA reusing content from one flavor to the other(s) and even incorporating the occasional DITA topic borrowed from the *big* spec. 

However, our LwDITA users who were already implementing it or planning to needed a reference product ASAP. I know that technical standards take time, and in my LwDITA book I have a quote from JoAnn Hackos explaining the speed of spec authoring. But our "competition" was not the DITA spec... not even the DocBook spec. LwDITA was competing with GitHub Flavored Markdown, Sphinx, and many other lightweight languages with a technical spec written by one or a few dudes and published on a website without the overview of a standards body like OASIS. We had the infrastructure of a highly regulated environment for a product with an audience of authors and developers who expected a blog post as a reference document.

We managed to sell the idea of a white paper (committee note in OASIS terminology) to the TC, and the "[Lightweight DITA: An Introduction Version 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/LwDITA/v1.0/LwDITA-v1.0.html)" committee note was published (revised in 2018 with input from Alan and other SC members). For our target audience(s), the committee note became the LwDITA spec, and I was very happy (and proud) when I went to the annual conference of the Society for Technical Communication and saw a team of Adobe product evangelists with printed copies of the committee note talking about how FrameMaker supported LwDITA. "I wrote that!", I said to my friend Laura Alice as we hunted down chocolate samples in the vendors room.  

Virginia Tech had been supporting my DITA/LwDITA habit with generous coverage of the organizational OASIS membership fees via the Department of English and then the Center for Humanities. As a university, VT expected a research-related outcome of my work with OASIS, and I pretty much needed a single-authored book for my promotion to full professor. I started working on "Creating Intelligent Content with Lightweight DITA" as a part history of the standard-in-development and part tutorial for people who wanted to start implementing LwDITA. 

For the historical part of the book, I interviewed a few former IBMers who worked with DITA and at one point or another lamented that the standard was becoming too complex for teams that did not need intense structure but could use some DITA-like benefits. I talked to the late James Mathewson, who did not know that I was co-chairing the LwDITA SC with Michael Priestley and originally thought I was just writing about LwDITA from an outsider perspective. In our interview, James lamented that LwDITA *fizzled* when Don Day retired and Michael moved to non-DITA worked in IBM. I told him that we had the committee note, and he said that  the actual audience of LwDITA did not need a spec or committee note that took years to develop. They needed, he claimed, a quick reference guide and examples. Oh, and an expansion to include JSON as a new LwDITA flavor. When is LwDITA 2.0 coming out?

For a couple of years, I worked on the book for a (mainly) academic audience, although at some conferences I have received positive feedback from industry managers and content developers. At the same time, Alan and I were following the OASIS recommendations and during weekends we were writing a LwDITA spec using XDITA, HDITA, and MDITA.

But the TC wanted LwDITA as a stepping stone for DITA adoption, and the LwDITA SC one day woke up with a new directive: the LwDITA spec **must** (RFC119 and all) be written in DITA XML and reuse content from the DITA spec. Lightweight formats shlightweight formats.  I acknowledge that the TC spec editors (lovely and incredibly knowledgeable individuals) spent hours working on a structure for the new LwDITA spec (written in DITA and reusing content from the DITA spec), but the work that Alan, Michael, and I did in our LwDITA spec written in LwDITA was discarded just like that.

The format and TC requirements won over the needs of our audience and the idea of making the LwDITA spec the ultimate LwDITA project. The DITA spec is a highly structured document that could double as a doctoral dissertation on content reuse. It is not lightweight at all, and it's all XML oriented and based. Adapting and reusing its contents for readers and (use cases) that involve HTML and Markdown because they perceive XML as being too complex for their needs was a frustrating nightmare. And that was my experience with the SC/TC for a couple of years.

At one point, after a long discussion about how a DITA-based spec was huge for Markdown users, Mark Giffin sent me the following cartoon:

![A cartoon by Mark Giffin showing Carlos surfing the DITA waves in a Markdown surfboard](/assets/img/uploads/pamjflmlkcfnkool.jpg "Surfing the DITA wave with LwDITA tools")

Now, after two years of trying to tame that wave and using the DITA 2.0 spec as the source for the LwDITA spec, I crash and let the wave take me to the shore. And the shore is comfortable. I am lucky that I still have my job(s) as full professor, CTO, and associate dean. Other members of the LwDITA SC really live for/of this... and that must be frustrating. 

I have questioned if LwDITA fizzled because of me. But then I remember how I recruited or involved Larry Kollar, Garen Torikian, Tom Johnson, Adam Retter, Hannah Kirk, and others. I talked to them and got them excited about LwDITA.... but the OASIS membership requirements and the spec development expectations from the TC diluted their original enthusiasm. LwDITA does not need the DITA infrastructure to reach its audience.

I will keep teaching DITA (and LwDITA) in my courses, and my current and next writing/research projects do mention DITA but are more embracing of other tools and approaches for structuring and delivering content. Today, we do not know if the LwDITA SC will continue. We do not know if there will ever be a LwDITA spec.

If anyone wants to talk more about DITA or LwDITA, I am here and happy to chat.
